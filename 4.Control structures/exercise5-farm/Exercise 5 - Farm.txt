Do the following changes to your farm program from Chapter 3 "Exercise 2 - Farm":
 
Use a switch statement to create a user menu. 
The user can type in a number (0, 1 or 2) that calls one of the following functions:

-	1: Data_query
-	2: Calculate_revenue
-	0: Exit program
 
The menu should reappear until the user enters the number 0 to exit the program (do-while loop).
A corresponding message should appear if a wrong input has been made.
